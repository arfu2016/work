What is this .NPY file?
It is a standard binary file format for persisting a single arbitrary NumPy array on disk. The format stores all of the shape and data type information necessary to reconstruct the array correctly even on another machine with a different architecture. The format is designed to be as simple as possible while achieving its limited goals. The implementation is intended to be pure Python and distributed as part of the main numpy package.
